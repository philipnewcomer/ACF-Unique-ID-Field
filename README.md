# ACF Unique ID Field

An [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) field which generates a unique ID value.

While this library is intended to be used in ACF repeaters where each field in a repeater block needs to be given a persistent unique ID, it can be used anywhere an automatically-generated unique ID is required.

## Installation

```
composer require philipnewcomer/acf-unique-id-field
```

## Usage

Select the "Unique ID" field type when using the ACF GUI. When creating a post, unique IDs will be automatically generated and immediately available.

## Notes

IDs will be generated in the following format:
